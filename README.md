### Shop Feature
- The bot includes a **shop system** where admins can select a channel for the shop.
- The shop automatically creates **two messages**:
  1. **Pouch Shop** â€” Users can buy pouches using **Crystara** currency.
    - Visual Example : <img width="1094" height="529" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d7c42f7-3547-443f-8563-5de1af5dd8a6" />

  2. **Role Shop** â€” Users can purchase roles using either **Crystara** or **coins**.
      - Visual Example :
        <img width="1080" height="813" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e150626f-4a58-4bd2-9f8e-3f33a614b7a3" />
        <img width="968" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/432e7de6-af02-47ec-ac1d-56d7f4a3acac" />


        
- This setup allows users to interact with the shop messages to make purchases directly.

### Notes:
- Some subcommands require additional parameters such as:
  - `user` â€” Target another userâ€™s vault (admin permissions required).
  - `id` â€” Specify the coin ID for actions like level up or removal.
  - `view` generates a dynamic image showing coins with stats and the userâ€™s profile picture.


## ðŸ–¼ Vault System

Vaults are represented as in-memory image files generated dynamically using `BufferedImage`. No file writes or persistent image caching are used â€” everything is built and sent in real-time with profile pictures and layout logic.(All the images are AI generated)
